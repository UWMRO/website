Manastash Ridge Observatory (MRO) is used by the University of Washington Department of Astronomy for undergraduate education. It is not typically open to the public, in part due to its location on a ridge above Ellensburg, Washington. This site chosen in the 1970s to give UW students access to the dry and dark skies available on the eastern slopes of the Cascades. Owing to its remote location, the observatory was built with its own water supply and accommodations sufficient for groups of students to stay for multiple night observing runs.

Underneath an [Ash Dome](http://www.ashdome.com/) sits a [30" Boller and Chivens telescope](https://bollerandchivens.com/?p=1105). They would look familiar to anyone who has used MRO since it was dedicated in 1972, but many other things have changed since then. Originally observers used photographic plates to record their images, but now we rely on computers and digital CCD cameras. You can read the history, and some of the best stories, on the [MRO 40th Anniversary page](http://depts.washington.edu/astron/old_port/MRO/index.html).

Today we work to involve UW Astronomy undergraduates in all operations of the facility.

- The [Best of MRO photo album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/qF1D4G1Ctw6QgSDG9) features many of their pictures!

- The observatory is in a beautiful location, see it from the  [MRO Webcam Live View](http://depts.washington.edu/mrouser/webcams/).

- We have worked to [reduce our power and water use](https://green.uw.edu/blog/2016-03/uws-manastash-ridge-observatory-gets-sustainability-overhaul).

- Our students were featured on a KNKX's radio show: [Manastash Ridge Observatory teaches UW students about space — and themselves](https://www.knkx.org/post/manastash-ridge-observatory-teaches-uw-students-about-space-and-themselves).

Our current instrumentation includes:

- An Andor thermo-electrically cooled CCD camera.

- A filter wheel (designed and built by UW students) with Sloan, Johnson-Cousins, H-alpha, and other filters available.

- UW students also designed and built a new backend for the telescope which provides a mount for this equipment.

The observatory was built in 1971 at the initiative of George Wallerstein, the first chair of the UW Astronomy Department. Construction was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation, as well as by funds from the state of Washington. The current instrumentation was designed and continues to be integrated with the telescope by the Astronomy Undergraduate Engineering Group, thanks in part to funding from the UW Student Technology Fee1. Along with funding from the UW Campus Sustainability Fund2, this work will help ensure MRO is productive for years to come. Central Washington University generously provides us with internet access via a microwave link.
