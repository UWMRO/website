## Old Hardware
- **Spyder**, an imaging camera with a field of view of 9' x 9', which is paired with a 7-slot filter wheel. Sloan, Johnson-Cousins, H-alpha, BG40 (wide band), and other filters are available. Any questions/requests should be directed to the [MRO Administrator](laws@astro.washington.edu).

- The apogee filter wheel--archived documentation: "Move the filter slide to its home position by launching the Filter Control software on Popeye. Click the 'Browse' button, then the 'Search' button on the next screen. Highlight the only return, '1 USB 0 Filter Wheel', in the search return window and click 'OK'. Select filter wheel 'AL FW50 7S' from the dropdown menu (it should appear by default) and click the 'Connect' button; the Filter Wheel is now ready to use. NOTE: Do not close this window - if you do, you will have to reinitialize the Filter Slide wheel. Move the Filter Wheel by selecting the desired filter position from the numerical dropdown menu adjacent to the 'Set Position' button, and then clicking 'Set Position'. Your commands will appear in the 'Status Output Log' at the bottom of the applet window. You may check the status of the Filter Wheel by clicking 'Get Position' to verify its location."
