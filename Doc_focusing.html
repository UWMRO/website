## Imexam in Pyraf ðŸ˜®
1. Start terminal, navigate to your data directory and start ds9 ('&' runs it in the background):

**$ ds9&**

2. Start pyraf:

**$ pyraf**

3. Display your focusing image (leave off ".fits", final number is which ds9 frame to use):

**--> display focus12000 1**

4. Run Imexam. Pyraf will move cursor to ds9 window without raising it.

**--> imexam**

5. Plot radial profile by pointing at star and pressing  '**r**' (no need to click on the ds9 window). Last three numbers are estimates of the fwhm, pick one.

6. Quit Imexam by pressing '**q**' in the ds9 window (not in the Pyraf window). Pyraf is ready for the next command: display, imexam, display, imexam, etc.


## Imexam with python ðŸ˜•
Documentation: https://imexam.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.1/imexam/imexam_command.html

7. Open terminal, start python and import imexam:

**> python**

**> import imexam**

8. Start your imexam connection:

**> viewer = imexam.connect()**

This should open up a ds9 window. If you get an error about a path or a permission error, I found one extra step that should make things work.  If you get this error:

1. Open a ds9 window (via shortcut or via a separate terminal)

2. In your python window, run â€˜imexam.list_active_ds9()â€™.  This should produce something like {'7f000001:51634': ('ds9', â€˜userâ€™, 'DS9', 'gsâ€™)}.  Use this window name in your connect line, as in, run: â€˜viewer = imexam.connect('7f000001:51634â€™)

9. Load your focusing image. Change the file path to whatever img you are using:

**> viewer.load_fits(â€˜./focusing/test.fitsâ€™)**

10. Scale the image (automatically does z-scale, but you can also do  â€˜asinhâ€™, etc.):

**> viewer.scale()**

11. Start imexam:

**> viewer.imexam()**

12. Mouse over to the ds9 window.   With the cursor on your target, press â€˜râ€™, and a radial profile plot should pop up.  

1. If it doesnâ€™t pop up, try again, making sure it registers the key youâ€™re pressing.

2. If you want to save the plot, press â€™sâ€™â€” it saves to the disk as â€˜imexam_plot.pdfâ€™.

3. If you want to plot in new windows to compare the plots, press â€˜2â€™ before pressing â€˜râ€™ again
